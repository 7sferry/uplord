# uplord
simple upload to server using spring boot and thymeleaf

I use this app for transfering files between devices via upload. to use this app, change 'upload-path' in application.yml to directory you wanted, for example 'C:\' for windows or '/home/username/' for linux or any directory path. It will create subdirectories inside based on file category at startup if does not exist. then, open 'localhost:8787' to start uploading,
